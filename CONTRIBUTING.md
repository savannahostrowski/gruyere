# Contributing to Gruyere

Welcome! Thank you in advance for your interest in contributing to Gruyere!

## The Basics

Gruyere welcomes contributions in the form of pull requests.

For small changes (e.g., bug fixes), feel free to submit a PR.

For larger changes (e.g., new functionality, new configuration options), consider
creating an [**issue**](https://github.com/savannahostrowski/gruyere/issues) outlining your proposed
change.

### Prerequisites

Gruyere is written in Go. You'll need to install the [Go toolchain](https://go.dev/doc/install) for development.

### Development

The easiest way to get set up with everything you need is to work in a Dev Container or in GitHub Codespaces. The Gruyere repo includes a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) configuration. By opening the repo in a Dev Container, you will have all tools/dependencies installed for you for easy contributing.

 > If you already have Visual Studio Code and Docker installed, you can install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) and then use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to open your fork. If you are using GitHub Codespaces, the environment will be automatically set up for you as the container is built.

If you'd like to use another editor/IDE, just create a fork + clone the repo!

Be sure to add EditorConfig if you aren't using the Dev Container. This will help you maintain consistent formatting across the project.
